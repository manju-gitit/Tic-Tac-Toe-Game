# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

<p>As Improvements I would like to keep track of a set of games like a tournament and declare the tournament winner  </p>

<p>To implement this feature, we'll need to have state variables to track the result of each game and the player of each game, keep a tally of the two states of these variables and by three rounds declare the final state of it for the final score and also player for the tournament winner</p>
